# Manifold

**Manifold** is the infrastructure that powers multiple independent game stores through a shared backend.

Just like **Valve** created **Steam**, Manifold enables anyone to create their own version of Steam — called an **Outlet** — while remaining fully interoperable with every other Outlet in the network.

---

## 🌐 What is Manifold?

Manifold is a platform that allows creators, studios, communities, and companies to build their own game distribution platforms using a single shared system.

Each store created with Manifold is called an **Outlet**.

Outlets are:
- Visually and operationally independent
- Powered by the same backend
- Fully interoperable with each other

A player can buy a game on one Outlet and download it on another — without losing progress, ownership, or access.

## 🔌 What is an Outlet?

In engineering, a **manifold** distributes a flow into multiple **outlets**.

In Manifold:
- **Manifold** is the distributor
- **Outlets** are the distribution points

Each Outlet is a full-featured game store:
- Custom branding and identity
- Its own community and curation
- Shared library, purchases, and save data

---

## 🎮 Key Features

- 🛒 **Buy once, access everywhere**  
  Games purchased on one Outlet are available on all others.

- 🔄 **Cross-Outlet downloads**  
  Download your games from any Outlet in the network.

- 💾 **Shared progress and saves**  
  Player progress is synchronized across all Outlets.

- 🧩 **Single integration for developers**  
  Developers integrate once and reach every Outlet.

- 🏗️ **Modular and scalable architecture**  
  Designed to support countless Outlets from a single core system.

## 🎯 Why Manifold?

Traditional game stores are siloed.
Manifold breaks those silos by separating **platform infrastructure** from **store identity**.

This enables:
- More freedom for creators
- More choice for players
- A healthier, interconnected ecosystem

---

## 🚀 Who is Manifold for?

- Game studios launching their own stores
- Influencers and curators building themed platforms
- Communities creating private or public marketplaces
- Companies distributing games internally or externally

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

Manifold is built on the idea that:
> **Infrastructure should be shared. Identity should be free.**
